% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point
% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 
% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

\begin{abstract}
Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems face unique challenges in balancing throughput, latency, and fairness due to highly variable request sizes and complex two-phase execution patterns. This project develops a discrete-event simulation framework to rigorously analyze the interplay between batching strategies and scheduling policies in production LLM serving systems like vLLM and SGLang. We model realistic workloads with non-homogeneous Poisson arrivals and heavy-tailed request distributions, implementing multiple scheduling policies (FCFS, SJF, Predicted-SJF, Priority) and batch processing strategies. Our preliminary results demonstrate that batch size selection critically impacts system performance: moderate batches (32-64) achieve 85\% GPU utilization while maintaining acceptable tail latency, whereas suboptimal configurations degrade p99 latency by 40-60\%. We observe a fundamental tradeoff between scheduling efficiency and fairness, with SJF reducing average latency by 15\% but increasing unfairness (Jain's index: 0.64 vs 0.82 for FCFS). Our planned comprehensive experiments will quantify these tradeoffs across diverse workloads and evaluate adaptive batching strategies for time-varying loads. This work provides the first rigorous, simulation-based analysis of LLM inference scheduling and offers practical configuration guidelines for production deployments.
